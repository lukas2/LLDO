# üê≤ LLDO - LLDB helpers by Lurado

## Motivation

While LLDB commands are nice, helpers in Swift are _way_ more convenient, easier to write, test and maintain.

This project has been heavily inspired by [@kastiglione](https://twitter.com/kastiglione). You should check out his [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Io2_W1iDLQ).


## Try It

1. Clone this repo
2. Open the `LLDOSwiftHelper.xcodeproj` Xcode project
3. Set a breakpoint in `AppDelegate.applicationDidBecomeActive
4. Run in the Simulator
5. Start messing around. For example

```
# Highlights
po UIView.current.highlightLayoutMargins(depth: 2)
po UIView.current.highlightLayoutMargins(false, depth: .max)

# Poking around
po UIButton.first()
po UIView.current.all(UILabel.self)
po UIView.grep("Pass")
po UIView.find(byAccessibilityID: "username_input")
po UIView.current.tree().filter { $0.isHidden }

# Changing stuff
po UITextField.first()?.enterText("lldo@lurado.com")
po UISwitch.first()?.slide()
po UIButton.first()?.tap()
# you can build powerful automations with this - see below

# For the rest we need additional LLDO's LLDB commands
# Hint: You can use drag and drop the path from Finder üìé
command script import </path/to>/LLDO

# Load a reference design to check for abberations
proofimage </path/to>/LLDO/LLDOSwiftHelper/demo_reference.png
po UIImageView.at(<memory address>).removeFromSuperview()
# OR
po UIView.root.overlay()
```


## Installation

Add the following line to your `~/.lldbinit`:

```
command script import /path/to/LLDO
```

This loads LLDO's LLDB commands by default and makes them available in every project. Whenever you are in LLDB you can type `lldo` to load the Swift helper methods.

If you want to _always_ have them available, create a symbolic breakpoint in `UIApplicationMain`, enter `lldo` as _Debugger Command_ and check the _Automatically Continue_ checkbox. You might even right click that breakpoint and move it to your user so it's automatically available in all your projects.


### ‚ö†Ô∏è Objective-C Only Projects on a Device

To be able to use the Swift helpers in an Objective-C only project on a device, you need to bundle the necessary Swift runtime libraries:

1. Add a single Swift file
1. Do **not** create a bridging header
1. make sure you `import UIKit`

See `(lldb) help load_swift_runtime` for details.


## Documentation

### Swift Helpers

The documentation of the Swift helpers lives at [lurado.github.io/LLDO](https://lurado.github.io/LLDO).

### LLDB Commands
#### Aliases

| Alias | Description|
|-------|------------|
| `ps` | Like `po` but always use Swift. _Very_ handy when using the Swift helpers in an Objective-C project. |
| `alias` | Create a LLDB command alias: `alias <name> <command>`. |
| `history` | Shows the LLDB command history. Like the Bash command. |
| `import` | Load a Python script: `import </path/to/script.py>`. |
| `shell` | Execute a shell command, e.g. `shell ls -la`. |
| `reload_lldbinit` | What it says on the tin. Very handy when developing commands. |

#### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `lldo` | Load the Swift helpers. |
| `load_swift` | Load a Swift source code file. |
| `load_swift_runtime` | Load the Swift runtime. Necessary in Objective-C only projects. |
| `load_image` | Creates an `UIImage` from a file on your local hard drive. |
| `proofimage` | Displays an image from your local hard drive as semi-transparent fullscreen overlay to compare your layout with a reference design. |

Use the built in `help` command for further details, e.g. `(lldb) help load_image`.


## Write Your Own

### Swift Helpers

1. Develop them like any other code in a Xcode project
1. Run an application and pause it to start LLDB
1. Use the [`load_swift` command](#commands) to load the code
1. Run your code
1. GOTO 1 (unfortunately loading a files twice in a LLDB session results in duplicate symbols)

### LLDB commands

1. Create a Python script containing the command code
1. Use the [`import` alias](#aliases) in your `.lldbinit` to activate it
1. Run an application and pause it to start LLDB
1. `reload_lldbinit`
1. Run your command
1. Modify as needed
1. GOTO 4 (reloading and re-defining commands in a LLDB session works just fine)


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Debugging Only!

This purpose of this project is **only** to make debugging and development easier. 
Do **NOT** include it in your releases.
